# HDP-Security-Practice-Test
## Step1 :- Setup HDP 2.6.5 Cluster with Ambaro 2.6.2
### Login to Ambari
Login to Ambari web UI by opening http://AMBARI_PUBLIC_IP:8080 and log in with admin/admin


You will see a list of Hadoop components running on your cluster on the left side of the page

They should all show green (ie started) status. If not, start them by Ambari via 'Service Actions' menu for that service
